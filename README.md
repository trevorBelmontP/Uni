# Warehouse Picking Application

A mobile-first warehouse picking application built for B2B and B2C operations. This app helps warehouse workers scan barcodes, pick items, and manage inventory efficiently.

## 🎯 What Does This App Do?

This application helps warehouse workers:
- **Scan barcodes** using their phone cameras
- **Pick items** from shelves systematically
- **Track inventory** in real-time
- **Navigate through picking tasks** efficiently

Think of it like a digital assistant that guides workers through their picking duties step by step.

## 📱 How It Works (User Journey)

1. **Start**: Worker opens the app and sees available picking lists
2. **Select**: Choose a picking list (like "Pick 50 items from Section A")
3. **Scan Tote**: Use camera to scan the tote/container barcode
4. **Scan Shelf**: Scan the shelf barcode to confirm location
5. **Pick Items**: Scan individual product barcodes and pick quantities
6. **Complete**: Finish when all items are picked

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend (What Users See)
- **Technology**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (makes it look good)
- **Navigation**: Wouter (moves between pages)
- **Mobile-First**: Designed for phones, works on computers too

### Backend (Behind the Scenes)
- **Technology**: Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Port**: Runs on port 5000
- **API**: Handles data storage and retrieval

## 🔗 Routing (How Pages Connect)

The app uses **Wouter** for navigation. Here's how pages connect:

```
/ (Home)
├── /picking → PickingLandingPage (Welcome screen)
├── /picklists → B2BPackingPage (Main picking lists)
├── /picklist/:id → PicklistDetailPage (Individual list details)
├── /tote-scanner/:id → ToteScannerPage (Scan container)
├── /shelf-detail/:id → ShelfDetailPage (Scan shelf)
└── /sku-scanner/:id → SKUScannerPage (Scan products)
```

**Navigation Flow**:
1. User starts at `/picking` (welcome page)
2. Clicks "Start Picking" → goes to `/picklists`
3. Selects a picking list → goes to `/picklist/123`
4. Clicks "Start Picking" → goes to `/tote-scanner/123`
5. After scanning tote → goes to `/shelf-detail/123`
6. Selects a shelf → goes to `/sku-scanner/123`
7. Completes picking → returns to shelf or list

- Ensure HTTPS connection (required for camera)
- Try refreshing the page

### App Not Loading
- Check if port 5000 is available
- Restart the development server
- Clear browser cache

### Navigation Issues
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all route definitions in App.tsx

## 💡 Understanding the Code

### For Non-Technical Users
- **Components** = Building blocks (like LEGO pieces)
- **Pages** = Different screens you see
- **Routing** = How you move between screens
- **API** = How frontend talks to backend
- **Database** = Where all data is stored

### Key Concepts
- **State** = Current condition of the app (what's selected, what's typed, etc.)
- **Props** = Information passed between components
- **Hooks** = Special functions that add functionality
- **Events** = User actions (clicks, typing, etc.)

This application is designed to be maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly for warehouse operations.
